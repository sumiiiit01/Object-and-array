1. What is the default value of Array for different data types?

ans
byte,short,int,long = 0
float,double        = 0,0
boolean             = false
Any object          = null

2. Can you pass the negative number in Array size?

Ans: No, you can not pass the negative number as Array size. If you pass a negative number in Array size then you will not get the compiler error. Instead, you will get the NegativeArraySizeException at run time.

3. Where does Array stored in JVM memory ?

Ans: Array is an object in java. So, Array is stored in heap memory
in JVM.

4. What are the disadvantages of Array?

Ans:
->To create an Array, contiguous memory is required. It is

possible in JVM that the memory is

available to accommodate

Array but memory available is not contiguous.

->The Array is a static data structure. It is of fixed size. We can not

increase or decrease the size of

the Array after creation.


5. What is an Anonymous Array in Java ? Give an example?

An array without any name (or reference) is called an Anonymous
Array. They are useful for the scenarios where we need one time
usage of Array.
For example,
Anonymous int array :
new int[] {2,3,4,5,6,7};
Anonymous String array :
new String[]{"Java , "Hungry"};

6. What are the different ways to traverse an Array in java?

->Using for loop
->Using for each loop


7. What is the difference between length and length() method Give an Examples?

Ans: length

An array is an object that holds a fixed number of values of the

same type.
The length variable in an array returns the length of an array i.e. a

number of elements stored in an

array.
Once arrays are initialized, its length cannot be changed, so the

length variable can directly be used

to get the length of an array.

The length variable is used only for an array.

Example:
public class Test {
public static void main(String args[]) {
int array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
System.out.println("Length of an array is: " + array.length);
}
}
Output: Length of an array is: 7
length()
The length() method is a static method of String class.
The length() returns the length of a string object i.e. the number of

characters stored in an object.

String class uses this method because the length of a string can be

modified using the various operations on

an object.
The String class internally uses a char[] array that it does not

expose to the outside world.

Example:
public class Test {
public static void main(String args[]) {
String str = "Welcome to Tutorials Point";
System.out.println("Length of String using length() method is:
" + str.length());
}
}
Output: Length of String using length() method is: 26
